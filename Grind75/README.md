# Grind75 explination

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75

I do not do much coding, more code reviews, and reverse engineering others code.

I'm doing this because I do not want to be caught off guard when we start doing interviewing again so I should at least be as prepared like future candidates.

# Why 4 Languages
I prefere C / C++ its how I natively think in code.  Rust has been an interesting side project and I don't natively think like it wants (It trys to protect us). Python becase there is just so much of it in the SysDE space ... I don't like it but its fast for basic things, including interviews

I will always be approaching the coding in this order (unless otherwise noted in the commit message):
1. C
2. C++ (hopeful refinement of C)
3. Python3
4. Rust

# Why Upload it?
I don't care if people see my implementations.  I would never ask these common interviewing questions so if they look this up I wouldn't use them.  

# Does this make it look like You're not as capible? 
I don't think so I've learned as you advnace through your Engineering role that you're doing more design and direction of work than working through more basic problems.  This includes how to set up processes and training for your team so they can ramp faster and be more effecitve. However as a higher level Engineer you SHOULD still keep fresh on basics.  I also find problem solving fun.
