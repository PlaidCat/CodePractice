# Grind75 explination

https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75

I do not do much coding, more code reviews, and reverse engineering others code.

I'm doing this because I do not want to be caught off guard when we start doing interviewing again so I should at least be as prepared like future candidates.

# Why 4 Languages
I prefere C / C++ its how I natively think in code.  Rust has been an interesting side project and I don't natively think like it wants (It trys to protect us). Python becase there is just so much of it in the SysDE space ... I don't like it but its fast for basic things.

# Why Upload it?
I don't care if people see my implementations.  I would never ask these common interviewing questions so if they look this up I wouldn't use them.  

# Does this make it look like You're not as capible? 
I don't think so I've learned as you advnace through your Engineering role that you're doing more design and direction of work that working through more basic problems.  However as a higher level Engineer you SHOULD still keep fresh on basics.  I also find problem solving fun.
